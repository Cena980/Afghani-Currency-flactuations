##Overview

This projects aims to analyze the patterns of Afghanistan currency flactuations between the years 2007 and 2024. Through which I am hopeful to relate and correlate efactors factors form inside and outside of the market in Afghanistan. The country has suffered from several political, economical, and agricultural disasters during the mentioned period. Through correlating these facotrs with inner-market changes, this project will determine whether and how impactful the factors have been in causing changes in the currency rate.
