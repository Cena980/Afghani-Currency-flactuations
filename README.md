<h2></h2>Afghani Currency (Currency of former Islamic republic and current Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan)</h2>


## Overview

This projects aims to analyze the patterns of currency flactuations in developing countries (Somalia and Afghanistan) since 1960. Through which I am hopeful to relate and correlate factors form inside and outside of the market in Afghanistan and Somalia. The countries have suffered from several political, economical, and agricultural disasters during the mentioned period. Through correlating these facotrs with inner-market changes, this project will determine whether and how impactful the factors have been in causing changes in the currency rate.


## Important Notes
Based on a study done by Fartun Ahmed at Simad University on factors that contribute to the changes in exchange rate he has discovered that Macroeconomic factors such as Trade balance, GDP, and inflation contribute the most.
However, besides that what contributes to changes in exchange rate in countries like Somalia and Afghanistan is the political state they are in.
