# Macroeconomic factors that affect/ cause currency flactuation are GDP, Inflation, Political changes, and reserve assets.

The two correlation charts between macro economic factors are as follows:

The currency rate flacutaion graph for both countries are as follows (*Note: The graph for Afghanistan has not yet been analyzed based on political events*).

# Foreign exchange Reserve Assets

A country's central bank holds or rather saves a considerable amount of its assets in foreign currencies (preferably a currency that is not too dependent on its own) to provide a cushio or a temporary save in the event that its own currency losses value or becomes unviable.
Central banks in each country use these reserves to buy time to fix the loss of value their currency has underwent.
In case of a sudden loss of value, the country can also limit the withdrawal amount from its banks to ensure that money does not leaeve the country suddenly. This usually happens when political changes happen. For instance, with the fall of the republic in 2021 in Afghanistan, people were trying to withdraw their assets and leave the country. To control that, *Da Afghanistan Bank* Limited the withdrawal amount to 200 USD per week to keep the currency rate from dropping further.
